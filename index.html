        This project was a collaborative effort of two students at the Faculty of Electrical
        Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague. It was put together as part of the
        course "Foundations of Multimedia Production".

          <p class="paragraph">
            Video's aspect ratio is 16:9. All footage was shot on an IPhone SE at 720p. In total, 12
            video tracks as well as 5 static images were used. Though mostly using OpenShot for
            editing the minimovie, we made use of a multitude of tools including iMovie for speeding
            up clips (timelapse) and iOS's default camera app for image stabilization. Transition
            effects were implemented to seamlessly connect different clips.

          <p class="paragraph">
            There are 3 main audio tracks in the movie - two voice recordings as well as a song
            provided for free for our use case according to its license. Additionally, an alarm
            clock sound was used (BigSoundBank). Tracks were edited and put into the according part
            of the video using OpenShot. Background soundtrack is changing volume in time to better
            fit the ongoing videoclip.
